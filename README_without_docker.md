# ROS1 Multi-Device Project (Lidar LD19 + Intel RealSense D435)

## Description
The project uses a Raspberry Pi as a ROS Master to connect and publish data from:
- DTOF LIDAR LD19
- Intel RealSense D435

A PC running Ubuntu 20.04 connects to the ROS Master on the Raspberry Pi and visualizes the data in RViz.
